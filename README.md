## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) installed
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts
- Stacks wallet for testing
- SIP-010 compliant token contracts for testing
- NFT contracts for testing NFT functionality

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xylosphere.git
cd xylosphere
clarinet check
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere create-vault 
     u144 ;; timelock (blocks)
     "Multi-asset vault conditions" ;; conditions
     (list 'SP1ABC...DEF 'SP2GHI...JKL) ;; authorized withdrawers
   )
   ```

2. **Deposit Fungible Tokens**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere deposit-token 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     .my-token-contract ;; token contract
     u1000000 ;; amount
   )
   ```

3. **Deposit NFT to Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere deposit-nft 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     .my-nft-contract ;; NFT contract
     u42 ;; NFT ID
   )
   ```

4. **Withdraw Tokens from Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere withdraw-token
     u1 ;; vault-id
     .my-token-contract ;; token contract
     u500000 ;; amount
   )
   ```

5. **Withdraw NFT from Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere withdraw-nft 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     u0 ;; nft-index in vault
   )
   ;; Returns: {nft-contract: principal, nft-id: uint, recipient: principal}
   ;; User must then call the NFT contract directly to complete transfer
   ```

6. **Set Emergency Recovery**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere set-emergency-recovery
     u1 ;; vault-id
     'SP3RECOVERY...ADDRESS ;; recovery address
     u1008 ;; recovery timelock
   )
   ```
