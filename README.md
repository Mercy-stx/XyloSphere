# XyloSphere üåê

> A decentralized platform for securely managing digital assets and NFT collections through flexible smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

XyloSphere empowers users to create sophisticated, conditional asset management systems with multi-layered security protocols. Built on Stacks with Clarity smart contracts, it provides a trustless environment for managing both fungible tokens and NFT collections with complex access controls, time-based conditions, and emergency recovery mechanisms.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üîê **Conditional Asset Management**
- Create vaults with customizable conditions and timelock mechanisms
- Set multiple authorized withdrawers with granular permissions
- Implement complex business logic for asset access control

### üé® **NFT Collection Management**
- Store and manage NFT collections securely within vaults
- Support for any Stacks-compatible NFT contract
- Individual NFT deposit and withdrawal with proper access controls
- NFT location tracking and vault association

### üõ°Ô∏è **Multi-Layer Security**
- Permission-based withdrawal systems for both tokens and NFTs
- Emergency recovery protocols with separate timelock mechanisms
- Owner-controlled vault activation/deactivation

### ‚ö° **Smart Contract Automation**
- Automated condition checking for withdrawals
- Time-based access controls using Stacks block height
- Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling
- NFT transfer validation and state management

### üéØ **User-Centric Design**
- Intuitive vault creation and management
- Real-time vault status monitoring with NFT inventory
- Flexible permission management system for all asset types

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) installed
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts
- Stacks wallet for testing
- NFT contracts for testing NFT functionality

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xylosphere.git
cd xylosphere
clarinet check
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere create-vault 
     u1000000 ;; asset amount
     u144 ;; timelock (blocks)
     "Standard access conditions" ;; conditions
     (list 'SP1ABC...DEF 'SP2GHI...JKL) ;; authorized withdrawers
   )
   ```

2. **Deposit NFT to Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere deposit-nft 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     .my-nft-contract ;; NFT contract
     u42 ;; NFT ID
   )
   ```

3. **Withdraw NFT from Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere withdraw-nft 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     u0 ;; nft-index in vault
   )
   ;; Returns: {nft-contract: principal, nft-id: uint, recipient: principal}
   ;; User must then call the NFT contract directly to complete transfer
   ```

4. **Withdraw Tokens from Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere withdraw-from-vault 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     u500000 ;; amount
   )
   ```

5. **Set Emergency Recovery**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere set-emergency-recovery
     u1 ;; vault-id
     'SP3RECOVERY...ADDRESS ;; recovery address
     u1008 ;; recovery timelock
   )
   ```

## üé® NFT Integration Features

### Supported Operations
- **Deposit**: Securely transfer NFTs into vault custody
- **Withdraw**: Retrieve NFTs with proper authorization
- **Tracking**: Monitor NFT locations and vault associations
- **Permissions**: Same access control system as fungible tokens

### NFT Storage Structure
- Each vault tracks its NFT count and status
- Individual NFT metadata stored with deposit information
- Bidirectional lookup between NFTs and their vault locations
- Support for any Stacks NFT contract implementing the standard trait

### Security Features

Run the test suite to ensure contract functionality:

```bash
clarinet test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Basic vault operations
- NFT deposit and withdrawal flows
- Permission management
- Error conditions and edge cases
- Emergency recovery scenarios
