# XyloSphere üåê

> A decentralized platform for securely managing digital assets through flexible smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

XyloSphere empowers users to create sophisticated, conditional asset management systems with multi-layered security protocols. Built on Stacks with Clarity smart contracts, it provides a trustless environment for managing digital assets with complex access controls, time-based conditions, and emergency recovery mechanisms.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Multi-Layer Security**
- Permission-based withdrawal systems
- Emergency recovery protocols with separate timelock mechanisms
- Owner-controlled vault activation/deactivation

### ‚ö° **Smart Contract Automation**
- Automated condition checking for withdrawals
- Time-based access controls using Stacks block height
- Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling

### üéØ **User-Centric Design**
- Intuitive vault creation and management
- Real-time vault status monitoring
- Flexible permission management system

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Clarinet](https://docs.hiro.so/clarinet) installed

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xylosphere.git

clarinet check
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere create-vault 
     u1000000 ;; asset amount
     u144 ;; timelock (blocks)
     "Standard access conditions" ;; conditions
     (list 'SP1ABC...DEF 'SP2GHI...JKL) ;; authorized withdrawers
   )
   ```

2. **Withdraw from Vault**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere withdraw-from-vault 
     u1 ;; vault-id
     u500000 ;; amount
   )
   ```

3. **Set Emergency Recovery**
   ```clarity
   (contract-call? .xylosphere set-emergency-recovery
     u1 ;; vault-id
     'SP3RECOVERY...ADDRESS ;; recovery address
     u1008 ;; recovery timelock
   )
   ```
